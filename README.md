# COVID19-BOT(Beds On Track)
Considering the pandemic situation, we are up with an idea to spread the information to every user regarding the number of beds available in the nearby hospitals 
along with the nearest testing facilities to confirm the status of infection using our BOT website. We have also planned to embed Ambulance service so that any patient
who suspects himself to be COVID-19 positive can call the ambulance to take him to the nearest hospital/testing centre/quarantine centre.<br>
This is a django based website to do the same (under development).

# Basic Requirements
  Front End- HTML,CSS,JS<br>
  Framework- DJANGO<br>
  Database Management Software- SQLite 3<br>
  
# Conceptual Schema of Database( At initial stages)
